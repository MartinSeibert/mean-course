# MeanCourse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev angular server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run 'npm start:server' to run nodejs locally using nodemon.

Note that the mongodb connection string is read in from an external file in the same level as project folder, so that must also be present and titled mongoConnectionString.txt

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `npm run start:server` to run the node.js backend.
